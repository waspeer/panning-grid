This is my implementation of an awesome [dribble animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/16075830-Archived-chronicles) by [Ali Zafar Iqbal](https://dribbble.com/Ferosnow95). I was inspired by one of the streams of [Keyframers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmYk7H-NNYLEe_LgBRYomA) to take on this challenge.

## Built With

I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with React and Typescript.
